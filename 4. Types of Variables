//There are 3 types of variables in Solidity, local, state and global

//State variables are stored on the blockchain. So you can save some data into a state variable, come back a week later and the data will still be there.
//Local variables are declared inside functions and are not stored in the blockchain.
//Global variables provide information about the blockchain
